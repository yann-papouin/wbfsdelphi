OpenSSL binaries are from the WIN32 full installer distributed on this page
http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html

If you have Borland C++ Builder, you can translate these dlls into lib files
by using the convert_to_bcc.bat

It's not necessary for you as the libs are commited to the repo.
